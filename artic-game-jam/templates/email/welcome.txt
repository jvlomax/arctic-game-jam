Woot!

Thanks for signing up to the Arctic Game Jam 2014, we're excited to have you on board and look forward to spending a productive weekend making something cool :)

We'll be starting officially at 7pm at Flow: Co-Working and Innovation Space with enough free pizza for all who have registered. Aside from the free food, this is a great chance to network and to form teams if you're so inclined!

Also, please remember to turn up by 8pm on the 12th of September to confirm your participation, or otherwise, let us know if you'll be delayed via email.

With that all said, we're looking forward to seeing you at the Arctic Game Jam 2014 - GLHF!


Best Regards,
The Actic Jam team
