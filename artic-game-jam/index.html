        Calling all developers, come join us at the inaugural Arctic Game Jam event in Tromsø on the 12th - 14th of September!

        Jointly organized by Tromsø’s own Bedriftsnettverk for spill & interaktiv produksjoner - this is an awesome opportunity for professionals and enthusiasts alike to network and take on an active role in the fast-growing development scene in Northern Norway.

        The Arctic Game Jam 2014 will be held at Flow: Co-Working and Innovation Space. The aim is for participants to work on developing a game idea based around a theme over a 48-hour period.  We’re expecting nothing less than a marathon session of devious designs and courageous coding!

        Ready for the challenge? Registration is now open at www.arcticgamejam.com with limited space available, so hurry and sign up now!

        Who can join?
        The Arctic Game Jam is open to anyone with an interest in developing games/interactive concepts meaning that participants with programming skills are particularly relevant.

        But making good games often take a variety of skillsets so we welcome artists, musicians and writers. You can always team up with programmers you meet at the event, find helpful tools that can help you flesh out your ideas, or consult with the various professional game developers at the event!
